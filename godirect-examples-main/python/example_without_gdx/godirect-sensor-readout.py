""" This example automatically connects to a Go Direct device via USB (if USB 
is not connected, then it searches for the nearest GoDirect device via Bluetooth)
and starts reading measurements from the default sensor at a period of 
1000ms (1 sample/second). Unlike the 'gdx_getting_started' examples that use the gdx module,
this example works directly with the godirect module. This example might
be important for troubleshooting, or if you do not want to use the gdx module.

If you want to enable specific sensors, you will need to know the sensor numbers.
Run the example called 'gdx_getting_started_device_info.py' to get that information.

Installation of the godirect package is required using 'pip3 install godirect'
