# Go Direct® Sensor Readout

Simple example of using the [godirect-py module](https://pypi.org/project/godirect/) to connect to a Vernier Go Direct device and log sensor values.

## API of godirect-py

Connect to the first available USB device, or closest BLE device within the default threshold, and collect 10 samples from the default sensor.
```python
from godirect import GoDirect
godirect = GoDirect()
device = godirect.get_device()
if device != None and device.open(auto_start=True):
	sensors = device.get_enabled_sensors()
	print("Connected to "+device.name)
	print("Reading 10 measurements")
	for i in range(0,10):
		if device.read():
			for sensor in sensors:
				print(sensor.sensor_description+": "+str(sensor.values))
				sensor.clear()
	device.stop()
	device.close()
godirect.quit()
```

Note that you can choose to enable USB, BLE, or both. By default both will be enabled.
```python
godirect = GoDirect(use_ble=True, use_usb=True)
```

Here is how to obtain a list of GoDirectDevice objects from the BLE and/or USB backends.
```python
# returns a list of GoDirectDevice objects
devices = godirect.list_devices()
```

Or you can let the library automatically find the nearest device for you.
```python
# returns a GoDirectDevice on success or None on failure
mydevice = godirect.get_device()

# to adjust the BLE threshold pass in a minimum dB value
mydevice = godirect.get_device(threshold=-200)
```

Once a device is found or selected it must be opened. By default, only information will be gathered on Open. To automatically enable the default sensors and start measurements, set the `open()` parameter to `auto_start=True`. With this parameter set to True there is no need to call the `enable_sensors()` and `start()` functions. Otherwise, if the parameter is set to `auto_start=False`, then you will call the `enable_sensors()` and `start()` functions.
```python
# returns True on success or False on failure
mydevice.open(auto_start=False)
```

Once a device is opened you can obtain a list of sensor objects available on the device.
```python
# returns a list of Sensor objects
sensors = mydevice.list_sensors()
```

Select the sensors you want to enable for data collection. If you do not call this function, then the default sensor(s) will be automatically enabled when `start()` is called.
```python
# pass a list of sensor numbers to enable
mydevice.enable_sensors([2,3,4])
```

Start data collection at the typical rate. If sensors were not enabled, the default sensors will be enabled when start is called.
```python
# start measurements at the typical data rate
mydevice.start() # returns True on success

# start measurements at 1000ms per sample
mydevice.start(period=1000)
```

After `start()` has been called, the enabled sensor objects are available
```python
# get a list of the GoDirectSensor objects that are enabled
mysensors = mydevice.get_enabled_sensors()
```

The `read()` method will block until data is returned so it is acceptable to read in a tight loop.

```python
for i in range(0,10):
	# read() will append new measurement(s) received to the values list in the Sensor object
	if mydevice.read():
		for sensor in mysensors:
			print(sensor.values)
			sensor.clear()
```

The `stop()` method will stop data collection on the device. 

The `close()` method will disconnect the USB or BLE device. 

The `quit()` method will stop the USB or BLE backends gracefully.

## Debugging

godirect uses the standard python logging module. You can set the logging verbosity to INFO or DEBUG to see more communication detail.

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig()
logging.getLogger('godirect').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
logging.getLogger('bleak').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
logging.getLogger('pygatt').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```
