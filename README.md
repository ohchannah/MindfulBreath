# MindfulBreath: Every Breath You Take, Every Mind You Wake

**MindfulBreath** is an interactive breathing system designed to support mindfulness novices by providing personalized biofeedback before meditation. It guides users through paced breathing using real-time respiratory data, visualized through dynamic animations of a human figureâ€”mirroring the sequence of a traditional body scan.

This repository contains the system's codebase along with example content files and experimental assets used in our study.

## System Overview

- The system consists of three stages:
  1. **Initialization** â€“ calibrates the userâ€™s breathing range.
  2. **Breath Cycle Recommendation** â€“ suggests a personalized breathing pace (â‰ˆ10% slower than baseline).
  3. **Breathing Exercise** â€“ visualizes breath as flow through body regions in the order of:  
     `spine â†’ right arm â†’ left arm â†’ head â†’ right leg â†’ left leg â†’ heart`  
     Each part is animated per two breath cycles (inhaleâ€“exhale Ã—2), synchronized with a square pacing path.

## Experiment Setup

The system was evaluated in a controlled study comparing passive relaxation, generic breathing apps, and MindfulBreath. Measures included EEG, respiration rate, and self-reported engagement.

## Per-Region Visualization Example

Each inhaleâ€“exhale cycle activates a specific body part in the visualization. This sequence aligns with the body scan practice to scaffold user attention and embodied focus.
